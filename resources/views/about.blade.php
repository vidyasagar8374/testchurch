                    <h3>Brief History of Yamjal Shrine Parish</h3>
                    <p class="pt-1 pb-1">
                        In 1926, Bishop Vismara might have visited the Village, for practically all the migrants were Catholics. Emjala was a Sub-station of St. Joseph’s Cathedral, Hyderabad, hence the Priests used to travel all the way to satisfy the spiritual needs of the people. The Baptism Register at the Cathedral indicates that from 1926 people from Emjala have been regularly baptized at the Local Church and entered at the Cathedral by all the subsequent Parish Priests and their Assistants until 1972.

            Emjala (also called Turka Emjala) is a Village situated about 17 kms from Hyderabad. It is situated on Nargarjuna Sagar highway. Being on the outskirts, it is away from the crowded city and basically presents a calm and serene surrounding. Catholic presence in the Village goes back to 1920 when fourteen families under the leadership of Kakumanu Innaiah (Kakumanu Chinnaiah, Addagatla Joji, Addagatla Rayanna, Policetti Arlaiah, Bonagiri Innaiah, Bonagiri Thomas, Bonagiri Chinnaiah, Addagatla Dhairnaiah, Chinnabathini Showraiah and four more families) from Kethepally in Nalgonda District, purchased 195 acres of land and settled there. They distributed the land equally among themselves and started cultivation. In 1926, Bishop Vismara might have visited the Village, for practically all the migrants were Catholics. Emjala was a Sub-station of St. Joseph’s Cathedral, Hyderabad, hence the Priests used to travel all the way to satisfy the spiritual needs of the people. The Baptism Register at the Cathedral indicates that from 1926 people from Emjala have been regularly baptized at the Local Church and entered at the Cathedral by all the subsequent Parish Priests and their Assistants until 1972. In the early days, the people built a Prayer Hall for the Word of God with mud walls and palm-leaves. In 1955, they collected Rs. 600/- and purchased 3 acres and 7 guntas of land for the Church. Fr. Udumala Anthaiah, the Assistant to Fr. F.X. Pinto constructed a small Chapel with a single room residence for the Priest in 1956. The same year the Catechist Sisters of St. Ann were invited to start a School. The Dispensary came up when Fr. B. Julian was the Cathedral Parish Priest

            In 1972, upon the initiative of Fr. Thirumalareddy Papaiah, Archbishop Samineni Arulappa erected Emjala as an independent Parish with Nadergul (Nandrakal), Mariapuram and Gowrainkota as its Sub-stations. Fr. Papaiah immediately renovated the existing Chapel and Presbytery. In 1976, foundation for a bigger Church was laid but with the untimely death of Fr. Papaiah (supposedly Fr. George Parathiparambil) with substantial contributions from Fr. Tiburtius Raj PIME, completed the Church. The inauguration of the new Church coincided with the Sacerdotal Ordination of Fr. Bonagiri Albert and Fr. Kakumanu Kasper on 12th February, 1977 by Archbishop Samineni Arulappa

            Initially St. Joseph was the Patron of Emjala (the Convent still maintains the name - St. Joseph’s Convent), but since 1972, a small group of Catholics from the city who had prior knowledge of the devotion to Infant Jesus of Prague frequented the Church. These city-Catholics came as pilgrims and made their Novena and the Parish Priest would oblige them with a special Holy Eucharist (later developed into Novena Masses). They experienced comfort and consolation. A miraculous cure through the favours bestowed by Infant Jesus was also reported. Fr. Chinnabathini Chinnaiah who was appointed Parish Priest on 03rd February, 1978 was the one who would not let any opportunity pass. He immediately saw the possibility of the small Village Parish grow into a Shrine. He celebrated the first Feast of Infant Jesus in the Village on 05th May, 1979 when a devotee donated a Statue of Infant Jesus to the Church, which was placed beside the Altar for the Feast day Mass, celebrated by the new Priests of that year. The Church was then rededicated to Infant Jesus. In 1980, the Papali family of Vazir Sultan Tobacco (VST) donated the present statue of Infant Jesus and proposed that the second Sunday of February be dedicated for a grand celebration of the Feast of Infant Jesus (this second Sunday tradition is still being continued). Fr. Chopparapu Arogyam, the immediate successor to Fr. Chinnabathini Chinnaiah popularized the Shrine in his six year tenure (1980 - 1986), when the miracle of a lame boy who was able to walk was reported at the Shrine

            Fr. Udumala J. Chinnappa Reddy was appointed as the Parish Priest of Infant Jesus Shrine at Emjala (1986-1997). He planned to improve the facilities of the Shrine and to make the Shrine more known to people across the states. During the 11 years of his tenure at the Shrine, at first began to provide a land mark for the Shrine on the main road with ‘the welcome Arch’. He constructed pilgrims Quarters in 1989 for comfortable stay of the pilgrims. He erected ‘Mary Land’ for the meaningful recitation of the Holy Rosary. The ’Holy Land’ or the Stations of the Cross were added to the shrine in 1992. He made efforts to propagate the devotion to the infant Jesus and also the Shrine of Emjala by sending a Catechist and the children in the boarding of St. Ann’s High School, Emjala during the holidays with Literature about Shrine to the main Parishes of the erstwhile A.P. He made audio and vedio Cassettes on the devotion to the Infant Jesus. He formed ‘Burra Katha’ Team (a Folk Art form of story-telling) and sent it to various Parishes in the State to perform and explain the miracles of Infant Jesus at Emjala and the value of devotion of Infant Jesus to the people. As the devotees increased, he convinced RTC authorities to ply “Infant Jesus Special buses” on the annual Feast day for the convenience of the devotees. He had the festival programme telecast on “Doordarshan” (Govt. TV) Programme. Thus the Shrine which was known to a few in the Twin Cities was made a popular Shrine attracting a huge number of devotees from the Twin cities and Telangana as wel

            Fr. Albert, son of the soil with the help of foreign donors built the first Village water tank in 1993. As the Shrine gradually became more popular, in order to accommodate the large gatherings an extension of the Church was planned in 1992. A ground floor and 45 x 25 square feet balcony was added to the existing Church. Also two Gothic style towers (100 feet high) were added with a center portion adding an ethnic look. Thus the entire front elevation is a unique design of its own. A bell weighing 150 kgs was also installed in one of the towers. The renovated and extended Shrine was blessed by Archbishop Samineni Arulappa on 12th February, 1995.

            In 1997, Fr. U.J. Chinnappa Reddy was transferred to another Parish. Fr. Marneni Devanand was appointed Parish Priest in his place. During his tenure, he projected the Iron pole of 45 feet in length with the Cross arranged with electrical lamps in front of the Church in 1998. Fr. Marneni Devanand was instrumental in getting the Shrine included in the Tourism Map of Andhra Pradesh. During this time Fr. Maurice Joseph, Coordinator of the Catholic Charismatic Movement conducted regular prayer meetings and healing services. When Fr. Marneni Devanand was transferred on 23rd May, 1999, Fr. Thumma Solomon took charge as the Parish Priest. With his coming all the Catholic families in Emjala had grown more in spiritual life. Fr. Thumma Solomon developed Church during his tenure. He led the Parish Community in Retreats, Prayers, Fasting etc. As a result of these prayers, a wonderful change had come in every Catholic family of Emjala. People were actively participating in Holy Mass and listening to Word of God and following Jesus in their life

            He also formed a singing crew (choir) and went about spreading the good news of God in surrounding areas. On every Saturday he made it a point to have a Prayer Day and on every Thursday there was poor feeding. The devotees extended their financial assistance to support it. Since 1999, Fr. Thumma Solomon brought about a spiritual renewal of the Shrine with the addition of a perpetual adoration Chapel (sponsored by Dr. K.L. Reddy’s family), blessed by Archbishop Marampudi Joji on 18th August, 2000 healing prayer services on every Saturday and full day prayer services on the 2nd Saturday of the month. Also to quench the physical thirst of the pilgrims a 30,000-liter-capacity, water tank was constructed in the Shrine premises. Fr. T. Lourdu as Parish Priest laid a Borewell in the Parish Church Campus. He also undertook the construction of the Cemetery Compound Wall in 2003. During his time Ms. Papamma of Gunfoundry gave to Fr. T. Lourdu a plot of 480 square yards of land adjacent to the compound wall of the Church campus but he registered it in the name of the Church. He planted many trees in the Church campus and also on both sides of the streets in Emjala Village. Fr. T. Lourdu with an idea of starting a new mission used to visit and celebrate Mass at Kings Valley near Chintapatla, which is 30 kms away from Emjala Parish Head-Quarters. Fr. Windy promised him to give some land but unfortunately didnot work out as he was no more in-charge of VRO, a year after he promised. Fr. T. Lourdu was visualizing to have a Lambada Mission, as there were almost 150 Thandas in that Region.
